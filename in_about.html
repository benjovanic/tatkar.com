			<br>God manifested in the Supreme Cosmic Dancer, Lord Nataraja. Dance 
			evolves from divinity. The sole purpose of a Dancer is to aquire the 
			most refined skills trough sheer dedication, discipline and devotion 
			by giving articulation to these, to enter into the spirit of 
			throbbing rhythm of nature and thus experience unity with God.<br>
			<br>The Kathak Dance belongs to North India. The word Kathak originally 
			meant story - telling with gestures. In ancient days professional 
			story - tellers delineated episodes from the great Epics through 
			simple, devotional and mimetic recitation. Thus like many other 
			dance forms in India, Kathak started as a Temple Dance. Under the 
			patronage of moghul rulers, however, Kathak evolved into highly 
			stylised and complex art for the delight of the aristocratic few.<br>
			<br>The Kathak Dance consists mainly in devising and executing rhythmic 
			patterns of time - beats. In its technique, Kathak gives equal 
			importance to pure dance (Nritta) and to mime or interpretative 
			expression (Abhinaya). The pure dance reveals intricate footwork and 
			a variety of spins or convolutions of the body (Chakkars), while the 
			mime generally concerns itself with an incident from the life of 
			Lord Krishna. Hand gestures and facial expressions are strong 
			aspects of communicating and relating stories.<br><br>The music employed is simple - the only accompaniments neede by a 
			Kathak performer are the Tabla, to provide rhythm and another 
			instrument, usually the Sarangi or Sitar to play the melody.<br><br>The Dancer learns to unfold a variey of delicate and expressive 
			poses. There is the pleasing play of the eyes and graceful movement 
			of the hands. This is followed by a series of Torahs which devised 
			to demonstrate the movements of the eyes, the eyebrows and the 
			chest. Then comes the gat, the miming part of the dance which 
			displays gat nikas or poseful steppings. There is free movement of 
			the body where the Gymnastic abilities of the performer also come to 
			the fore. The tempo gradually heightens, culminating in a grand show 
			of the artistes originality and virtuosity. A special feature of the 
			Kathak Dance is its tremendous footwork. It gradually gains in 
			speed, tempo and reaches a climatic degree. The artiste gives a 
			brillant demonstration of both rhythm and movement. A Kathak Dancer 
			gets an opportunity to portray different moods in different styles 
			of footwork and movement.<br><br>One of the outstanding exponents of the Benares Gharana (tradition) 
			of Kathak was Gopi Krishna. His performances are marked by 
			individualistic interpretation, superb showmanship, uncanny tempo 
			and an imagintive temperament. Gopi Krishna was the first to 
			introduce Tarana ( similiar to Tillana in Bharata Natyam) into the 
			Kathak style.<br><br>In the art of drama, Bharatha was the teacher who leads the pupil 
			from &quot; Darkness of ignorance to the Light of Learning. &quot; There is no 
			Wisdom, Knowledge, Art, Craft, Device or Action that is not to be 
			found in the Natya, &quot; says the Guru Bharata. In ancient India Natya 
			included Dance, Drama, Musix.<br><br>Wither the hand goes, the glance follows<br>Wither the glance goes, the mind follows<br>Wither the mind goes, the mood follows<br>Wither the mood follows, there is real creativeness born.<br>
			<br>Through the hand, the Dancer possesses a power infinite in its 
			capacity to portray the tragedy and exaltation of the human being. 
			Somewhere in the recesses of cosmic creativeness, the hands become 
			the conscious translators of thought to the Universe.<br><br>&nbsp;</td>
